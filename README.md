## Note
This is a fork of CXAPI which uses Xeno. I am only a maintainer of CXAPI, due to it being randomly discountinued. All thanks go to Xeno and CXAPI for their work, as the work I am doing for this project is very minimal compared to what they have done.

## Dependencies
- [**httplib**](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)
- [**xxhash**](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)
- [**zstd**](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
- [**openssl**](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)

### Credits
[**Rizve**](https://github.com/Riz-ve) for creating Xeno, the backbone of this project.
[**Volxphy**](https://github.com/volxphys) for creating CXapi, the original API of this project.
